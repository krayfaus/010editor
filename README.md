# A collection of 010Editor stuff

This repository contains scripts and templates that I've made or
edited to suite my own purposes, mainly for game modding, most will
require [010Editor](http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor) to work.

If you happen to find a file, that these scripts/templates cannot
properly parse, please feel free to email me, or submit an issue to
this repo. I will gladly take a look at the issue and may even
attempt to fix it! If you could attach the offending file, that
would be even better.
